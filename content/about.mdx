I'm just a guy from Tampere, Finland. ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡®

Full Stack Developer, death metal enjoyer, linux fanboy and a university dropout.

On my free time I like to work on my little hobby projects (such as this website), build and mod mechanical keyboards, tweak my arch linux configuration, cook great food and take photos. I practice minimalism in both design and philosophy, as you might be able to tell from the design of this page.

Maintainer of multiple open source projects, my most successful creation has to be [Miso Bot](https://misobot.xyz), a general purpose discord bot. What started as a little python script I wrote after finishing Programming 101 in 2018 quickly grew in popularity and now has over 200 000 users in it's database.
