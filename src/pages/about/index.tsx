            I specialize in the backend and Linux side of things, but as an artist I
            also enjoy frontend design work. My favourite language is Python.

            I&apos;m an open source advocate and usually avoid proprietary or bloated
            software whenever possible. As a result of this I run Arch Linux (btw) on my
            computers. I feel right at home in front of a UNIX terminal and I actually
            try to avoid using graphical frontends if I can. Privacy and transparency
            are also very important to me, so I must disclose that this website has
            tracking, not provided by Google of course, but my self-hosted{' '}
            <a href="https://github.com/plausible/analytics">plausible</a> server.

            This website serves as my personal playground for anything I want to create,
            be it blog posts, digital art or movie reviews, without the pressure or
            algorithms of social media. It&apos;s created with Next.js leveraging the
            server side rendering capabilities to render all content in advance to
            achieve maximum responsiveness for the end user. As a fan of minimalism, the
            design of the website reflects those ideals.
